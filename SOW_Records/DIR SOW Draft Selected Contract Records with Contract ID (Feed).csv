Your draft SOW has been reviewed. Since the draft has already been submitted to vendors, DIR will approve your final SOW once the following change is made:

The word ?consulting? is used in SOW section 1. Introduction/Background:

The Texas Department of Information Resources? objective is to select vendors and services that provide IT Research and Advisory Subscription Services to assist DIR in various levels of IT strategic planning, executive leadership, consulting and projects that focus on key IT technologies, processes and organizational issues.

NOTE: The Texas Department of Information Resources is submitting two separate Statements of Work to the IT Research and Advisory Subscription Services vendors.   The Chief Technology Office SOW is focused on selecting vendor(s) that provide IT Research and Advisory Subscription Services to assist DIR in various levels of IT strategic planning, executive leadership, consulting and projects that focus on key IT technologies, processes and organizational issues.   The Office of the Chief Information Security Officer?s SOW is to select a vendor to provide a baseline education of security governance, best practices, policies and architecture to state security practitioners, architects, IT managers and key executives.  These services are separate efforts.

-	All DBITS Contracts prohibit consulting services from being sold through the contract. 

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me directly. Otherwise, I will look forward to the submission of your final SOW with all references to consulting removed.

Please note that the originally approved SOW had these same project position titles listed in Exhibit A.

On that basis, and in consideration of and in compliance with TGC 2254, I ask that we not require the vendor to make change to these titles.

?	Section 5.1, General Responsibilities, first sentence, replace ?job? with ?SOW?
?	Section 8.1, Period of Performance.  Recommend removing paragraphs B and C and replace with ?The period of performance for this service is from date of award through August 1, 2017.?
?	Section 9, Additional Customer Terms and Conditions, delete this section as it states there are no additional terms and conditions.
?	Section 10.1, Response Formatting, Item 3 ? Company Information ? this seems a bit excessive.  Recommend reviewing and revising.
?	Section 10.1, Response Formatting, Item 5 ? Key Personnel, 3rd bullet has information included that should be addressed under a separate item:  ? Vendor must submit a staffing plan for this project. If not all positions are currently filled, Vendor must submit the qualification requirements for that position.

o	Table 4, Software Costs ? delete in its entirety.  DBITS contracts do not allow for the purchase of hardware or software.

","12/9/20 - SOW approved; email to submitter to review the following items: 

Item 4.1, Project Work Plan, is referred to as a deliverable due within 8 business days of contract award. Should the plan be accepted by DIR prior to further work being performed by the vendor? Is the Project Work Plan incorporated into the proposed Phase 1?
Item 4.2, Bi-Weekly Status Reports, will the reports be sent to the DIR POC for internal distribution.  
Section 5,  Acceptance, states the DIR will review and provide comment for Phases 3 and 4. Will DIR provide the vendor formal written acceptance of Phase 5, Final Report? This should be taken into consideration for the purpose of invoicing and payment.

Design a data warehouse that helps stakeholders make better informed decisions by being able to analyze data with greater flexibility and integrate disparate system. To do this the data must be structured in a business-driven, dimensionally modeled approach that allows for queries focused on parameters, yet flexible enough to allow for many different groupings and categorization of these measures. This structure is optimized for high-performance queries as stakeholders usually need to search large amounts of transactions in a compressed and usable result set.",The correct category needed is for ITSAC which is currently not available thru this portal. NTE for this project is estimated at 1.25M throughout the years. The initial year has an estimated NTE of 350K.,"1/8/21 - email to submitter addressing items to address prior to soliciting approved vendors: the following items need to be included in the SOW:

	Section 4.2, Dimensional Data Modeler ? check first paragraph. This appears to be a repeat of Section 4.1 Business Analyst
	Section 4.3 ? Review and confirm if ?ELT? is correct. If so, define the acronym on first use. 
	Section 6 ? Period of Performance ? review term. Should it be a base period of twelve (12) months with two (2) one-year optional renewal periods?
	Tracking of vendor?s staff working on this project should be included as a requirement of this SOW.? For example: ?Vendor must provide weekly (bi-weekly) time report indicating the staff and hours worked the previous week. This report must be approved by DIR prior to the vendor submitting an invoice.?? You may want to add this as a reporting requirement or possibly include with Section 9, Additional Considerations. The approved time report should also be a part of what is submitted for invoicing/payment.
	Include statement advising all work must be performed within the Contiguous 48 United States.
	Section 14 ? Response Evaluation Criteria, 2nd paragraph update to read: In accordance with Texas Government Code, Chapters 2155.074, 2155.075, and 2157.003. Vendor performance may be used as a factor in award.
?
Due to ITSAC being a newly added category for SOW review, the contracts that were included as Additional Contracts are the appropriate vendors to solicit for these services.
?
Once these revisions have been made, you may solicit to the approved vendors.
