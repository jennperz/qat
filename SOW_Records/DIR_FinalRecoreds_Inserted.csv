Your draft SOW has been reviewed. Since the draft has already been submitted to vendors, DIR will approve your final SOW once the following change is made:

The word ?consulting? is used in SOW section 1. Introduction/Background:

The Texas Department of Information Resources? objective is to select vendors and services that provide IT Research and Advisory Subscription Services to assist DIR in various levels of IT strategic planning, executive leadership, consulting and projects that focus on key IT technologies, processes and organizational issues.

NOTE: The Texas Department of Information Resources is submitting two separate Statements of Work to the IT Research and Advisory Subscription Services vendors.   The Chief Technology Office SOW is focused on selecting vendor(s) that provide IT Research and Advisory Subscription Services to assist DIR in various levels of IT strategic planning, executive leadership, consulting and projects that focus on key IT technologies, processes and organizational issues.   The Office of the Chief Information Security Officer?s SOW is to select a vendor to provide a baseline education of security governance, best practices, policies and architecture to state security practitioners, architects, IT managers and key executives.  These services are separate efforts.

-	All DBITS Contracts prohibit consulting services from being sold through the contract. 

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me directly. Otherwise, I will look forward to the submission of your final SOW with all references to consulting removed.
